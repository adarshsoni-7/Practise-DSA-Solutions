/*
Explanation:
------------
This program performs LEFT ROTATION of an array by `k` positions.

Steps:
1. Input the size of the array `n` and its elements.
2. Input `k` = number of left rotations.
3. Compute `k = k % n` because rotating an array `n` times results in the same array.
   - Example: For n=5, rotating 7 times = rotating 7 % 5 = 2 times.
4. Repeat the following k times:
   a) Save the first element in `temp`.
   b) Shift all elements one position left.
   c) Place `temp` at the last position.
5. Print the rotated array.

Why k % n?
----------
If k > n, then after every n rotations, the array looks the same.
So we only need to rotate the array `k % n` times for the correct result.

Dry Run:
--------
Input:
n = 5
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
k = 7 â†’ k % n = 2 (because 7 % 5 = 2)

Rotation 1:
temp = 1
Shift: [2, 3, 4, 5, 5]
Place temp: [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]

Rotation 2:
temp = 2
Shift: [3, 4, 5, 1, 1]
Place temp: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

Output after 2 rotations:
3 4 5 1 2

Time Complexity: O(n * k)  (for each rotation, we shift n elements)
Space Complexity: O(1)     (no extra array used)
