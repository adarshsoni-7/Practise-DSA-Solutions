------------------------------------  EXPLANATION  ------------------------------------

ðŸ‘‰ This program calculates the factorial of a given number using a `while` loop.

âœ” Step-by-step:
1. We take input `n` from the user.
2. We initialized a variable `factorialOfN` as 1, because factorial multiplication starts with 1.
3. We used a `while` loop because:
   - âœ… We **know where to start** (from `n`)
   - âœ… We **know where to stop** (`n > 0`)
   - âœ… We **know how to move** (by decreasing `n` each time)
   That's why using a `while` loop is more meaningful and clear in this case.
4. Inside the loop, we multiply `factorialOfN` by `n` and then decrement `n` by 1.
5. Once `n` becomes 0, the loop stops and we print the result.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
If user enters `5`, the loop works like this:
â†’ 1 Ã— 5 = 5
â†’ 5 Ã— 4 = 20
â†’ 20 Ã— 3 = 60
â†’ 60 Ã— 2 = 120
â†’ 120 Ã— 1 = 120

Final output: `The factorial of given number is: 120`

ðŸ§  Note:
We use `long long` for `factorialOfN` because factorial values grow very fast.
