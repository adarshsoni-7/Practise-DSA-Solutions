ðŸ‘‰ This program calculates the sum of all even and odd numbers from 1 to a given number `n`.

âœ” Step-by-step:
1. We take the number `n` as input from the user.
2. We initialized two variables: `evenSum` and `oddSum` as 0.
3. We used a `for` loop because:
   - âœ… We **know where to start** (from 1)
   - âœ… We **know where to stop** (at `n`)
   - âœ… We **know the step/increment** (i.e., `i += 1`)
   This makes `for` loop a perfect fit here â€” simple and clean for known ranges.
4. Inside the loop, we check whether `i` is even or odd:
   - If `i % 2 == 0`, itâ€™s even â†’ add to `evenSum`
   - Else, itâ€™s odd â†’ add to `oddSum`
5. After the loop ends, we print both sums.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
If user enters `5`, the loop does:
- i = 1 â†’ odd â†’ oddSum = 1
- i = 2 â†’ even â†’ evenSum = 2
- i = 3 â†’ odd â†’ oddSum = 1 + 3 = 4
- i = 4 â†’ even â†’ evenSum = 2 + 4 = 6
- i = 5 â†’ odd â†’ oddSum = 4 + 5 = 9

Final output:
`The sum of all even numbers till given num is: 6 and of odd is: 9`
